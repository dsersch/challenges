        Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
        
        If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
        
        Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
        
        Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.
    </p>

                  }
